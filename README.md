# Weather App 🌤️

A simple weather app built with React.js, Tailwind Css, weather API for fetching data weather information and here we can search for current weather conditions by city name and location coordinates.

### Approach 
In this particular application I've used a package called Axios for handling API calls. To manage the state of application I've gone with the context API for managing different states of app like fetching weather data by city names and by coordinates with the help of inbuilt API available for getting coordinates in the browser itself.
And we also manage loading state and error state to indicate the fetch success or failure states and finally to manage search history, I've gone with local storage to store user previously searched cities.
